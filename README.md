# Week-7-Challenge- Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler
This is the Challenge for Week 7 of the Bootcamp. Due date is the 31st January at 23:59. This challenge allowed me to learn more about how to implement Moment.js into sites. I initially did some work on this a while ago closer to the submission date, got a bit lazy and forgot about it entirely. Since my original code, I have learn how to use arrow functions, so I came back and re-wrote some old code to gain some more practice with this. This submission also made heavy use of if else statements, which was nice as it meant I got more practice with it. Syntax is pretty easy to remember at this point. This project also gave me some experience with the append() jQuery method for inserting content. 

The link for the deployed site is:

Here are some screenshots of the deployed site:

# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Your Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```
 
## Acceptance Criteria

The app should:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
